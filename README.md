# Seizure Forecasting System

This project implements a seizure forecasting system using physiological data from wrist-worn devices. 
The system processes multivariate time-series data, extracts features, and uses an LSTM-based neural network for predictions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your data files to the `data/` directory.
   - `wearable_data.csv`: Sensor data from wrist-worn devices.
   - `seizure_events.csv`: Seizure labels.

4. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
